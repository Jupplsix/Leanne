<h1>Welcome To The Blog</h1>
<p>Hello, testing testing.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Nothing Happened, it's boring. .-.</p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p> More boringness, but I found a dust bunny under the desk, i'm afraid there might be more...</p>
<h4>Day 4 - The Awakening</h4>
<p>My fears have been confirmed, the dust bunnies are plotting something, this might be worse then I first expected.</p>
<h4>Day 5 - Preparing</h4>
<p>They are here and they are coming, I have created a safe room just in case they are strong enough to get into my usual room. I just hope that isn't the case.</p>
<h5>Day 6 - The Dust Bunny Takeover</h5>
<p>Oh no, this is bad, really bad, the dust bunnies have forced their way through my room and are currently breaking down the defence into my safe room. Time is running out. More updates coming soon, I hope it isn't too late.
<h4>Day 7 - Hello?</h4>
<p>Hello? Is this working? Good. The dust bunnies are currently scowering the area, looking for any signs of life. I made a bunker in the corner of the safe room and i'm recording this on a backup recorder I found. The lights are off and i'm hoping if I stay quiet enough they will leave. But only time will tell..</p>
<h4>Day 8 - All is not well.</h4>
<p>The dust bunnies have not retreated as I thought they would, instead, they have decided that my safe room is the perfect place to set up camp. The recorder battery is running out and I think the light may be getting their attention..</p>
<h5>Day 11 - All is getting better.</h5>
<p>Ive put a new battery into the recorder and the dust bunnies seemed to have moved away from my hiding spot. I just hope it stays that way.</p>
<h4>Day 13 - Planning Escape Routes</h4>
<p>To my surprise, the dust bunnies have found a secret tunnel inside one of the walls in the safe room. A tunnel that even I didn't know existed. It got me thinking. If there is one tunnel, there may be more. This could be my only hope of escaping at this point.</p>
<h3>Day 14 - Success!</h4>
<p>I've found one! Turns out, there is more tunnels inside these walls. Where they came from, I do not know. But what I do know, is that these tunnels hold the key to my survival.</p>
<h4>Day 15 - More Surprises</h4>
<p>I've made my way into one of the mysterious tunnels. I don't know what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting this. It is another room. I really have no idea how I did't know about this when I bought this house, but here it is.</p>
<h4>Day 17 - Secrets and Dust</h4>
<p>I am confident now that the dust bunnies are no longer looking for me. Which meens I have time to explore this room a little more. It's pretty dark and dusty. I've had enough of dust for this week and the light the recorder is giving off is not doing me any good. More updates on the way.</p>
<h3>Day 18 - Dark and Dank</h3>
<p>I have tried to explore this room, but there is so much cobwebs and it is truely dark down here. While feeling around the edges I noticed a parculiar box in the corner, unfortunately I cannot reveal it's secrets just yet, since it's locked. But I will find a way to open it soon. Just need a little more time..</p>
