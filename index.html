<h1>Welcome To The Blog</h1>
<p>Hello, testing testing.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Nothing Happened, it's boring. .-.</p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p> More boringness, but I found a dust bunny under the desk, i'm afraid there might be more...</p>
<h4>Day 4 - The Awakekning</h4>
<p>My fears have been confirmed, the dust bunnies are plotting something, this might be worse then I first expected.</p>
<h4>Day 5 - Preparing</h4>
<p>They are here and they are coming, I have created a safe room just in case they are strong enough to get into my usual room. I just hope that isn't the case.</p>
<h5>Day 6 - The Dust Bunny Takeover</h5>
<p>Oh no, this is bad, really bad, the dust bunnies have forced their way through my room and are currently breaking down the defence into my safe room. Time is running out. More updates coming soon, I hope it isn't too late.
<h4>Day 7 - Hello?</h4>
<p>Hello? Is this working? Good. The dust bunnies are currently scowering the area, looking for any signs of life. I made a bunker in the corner of the safe room and i'm recording this on a backup recorder I found. The lights are off and i'm hoping if I stay quiet enough they will leave. But only time will tell..</p>
<h4>Day 8 - All is not well.</h4>
<p>The dust bunnies have not retreated as I thought they would, instead, they have decided that my safe room is the perfect place to set up camp. The recorder battery is running out and i think the light may be getting their attention..</p>
