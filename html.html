<h1>Welcome To The Blog</h1>
<p>Hello, testing testing.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Nothing Happened, it's boring. .-.</p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p> More boringness, but I found a dust bunny under the desk, i'm afraid there might be more...</p>
<h4>Day 4 - The Awakekning</h4>
<p>My fears have been confirmed, the dust bunnies are plotting something, this might be worse then I first expected.</p>
<h4>Day 5 - Preparing</h4>
<p>They are here and they are coming, I have created a safe room just in case they are strong enough to get into my usual room. I just hope that isn't the case.</p>
<h5>Day 6 - The Dust Bunny Takeover</h5>
<p>Oh no, this is bad, really bad, the dust bunnies have forced their way through my room and are currently breaking down the defence into my safe room. Time is running out. More updates coming soon, I hope it isn't too late.
